### What is different Green Thread vs Native Thread ?

| FEATURES   | GREEN THREAD (deprecated)                                                                                                                           | NATIVE THREAD                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Managed by | JVM without any kind of underlying OS support.                                                                                                       | JVM with the help of underlying OS support.                                                                                                     |
| Scope      | Implemented at the application level and managed in user space.                                                                                      | the OS level (by using OS multithreading API) and managed in kernel space.                                                                      |
| Other name | User-level threads.                                                                                                                                | Kernel-level threads.                                                                                                                         |
| Mechanism      |  [ManyToOne model](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-3461/ch2mt-41/index.html) - Only one green thread can be processed at a time: <br/> <ul><li>Context switches all Java threads within one operating system process.</li><li>Run on multi-core processors but cannot take advantage of multiple cores.</li></ul>  | [ManyToMany model](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-3461/ch2mt-31/index.html) - Execute threads on separate individual cores concurrently: <br/> <ul><li>Each Java thread is mapped to one threads library thread (using the operating system threads library).</li><li>it to take complete advantage of multi-core processors.</li></ul> |
| Complex    | Synchronization and resource sharing is easier for green threads and hence execution time is also less.                                             | Thread synchronization and resource sharing become complicated. This increases execution time of threads.                                      |
